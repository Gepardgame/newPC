	With that repo, you can set up a new Debian distro, by:
		- Installing necesary, useful things
		- automaticly configure them (as I like, you can juts change some things in the files and some there asked to enter)
		- setup up useful scripts from that repo and initialice most of them as commmands
		- initialice a firewall for some things
		- update the .bashrc-File with the from that repo
